# Valve Developer Community Text Editor Extended v0.1.1

Changes the textarea for editing pages to a more improved version. Designed for the Valve Developer Community site.

**This is a temporary editor, the "Extended" is there to prevent any confusion until v0.2 comes out.**

**This extension may be unstable because itâ€™s still under development. 
By installing it, you agree that I (as the creator of this extension) am not responsible for any shortcomings. 
You also agree that you will install the unpacked extension yourself.
This is necessary due to the fact that browsers can block packaged extensions installed not from their store.**
