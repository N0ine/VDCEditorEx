# Valve Developer Community Text Editor Extended v0.1.1

Changes the textarea for editing pages to a more improved version. Designed for the Valve Developer Community site.

**This is a temporary editor until v0.2 comes out.**

**This extension may be unstable because itâ€™s still under development. 
By installing it, you agree that I (as the creator of this extension) am not responsible for any shortcomings. 
You also agree that you will install the unpacked extension yourself.
This is necessary due to the fact that browsers can block packaged extensions installed not from their store.**

## New stuff since v0.1

- Fixed color of the editor after the site upgrade
- Added support for RTL
- Added a button for each type of wiki tag ([[Link]], {{ACategory}}, '''Apostrophes''')
